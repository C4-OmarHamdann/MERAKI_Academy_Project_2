              Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally fit high school student living in
              Sendai with his grandfather. He regularly avoids the track team
              due to the time commitment required for it, despite his innate
              talent for the sport. Instead, he chooses to join the Occult
              Research Club; due to the freedom it allows him in attending,
              which means he can visit his dying grandfather in the hospital
              every day. In June 2018, on his deathbed, his grandfather instills
              two powerful messages within Yuji: "always help people" and "die
              surrounded by people". After his grandfather's death, Yuji
              interprets these messages as one statement: everyone deserves "a
              proper death". He is then confronted by Megumi Fushiguro, a
              sorcerer who can control curse-animals called "shikigami" who
              informs him of a high-grade cursed charm talisman at his school.
              His friends at the Occult Club unsealed the talisman, a rotting
              finger, which attracted Curses to the school, creatures that are
              brought about through negative emotions and are strengthened by
              consuming magical powers present in sorcerers or such charms. Yuji
              swallows the finger to protect Megumi and his friends and becomes
              the host of Ryomen Sukuna, a powerful Curse. Due to Sukuna's evil
              nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and by
              extension, Yuji) immediately. However, despite being possessed,
              Yuji is still able to retain control over his body for the most
              part. Seeing this, Satoru Gojo, Megumi's teacher, decides to take
              him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School to propose a plan
              to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence until he consumes
              all of Sukuna's fingers, allowing them to kill Sukuna once and for
              all.
